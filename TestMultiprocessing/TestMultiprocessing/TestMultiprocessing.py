#we'll keep the same plotting function, except for one change--I'm going to use the multiprocessing module to report the plotting of the graph from the child process (on another core):
def plot_a_graph():
    f,a = plt.subplots(1)
    line = plt.plot(range(10))
    print multiprocessing.current_process().name,"starting plot show process" #print statement preceded by true process name
    plt.show() #I think the code in the child will stop here until the graph is closed
    print multiprocessing.current_process().name,"plotted graph" #print statement preceded by true process name
    time.sleep(4)

#use the multiprocessing module to perform the plotting activity in another process (i.e., on another core):
job_for_another_core = multiprocessing.Process(target=plot_a_graph,args=())
job_for_another_core.start()

#the follow print statement will also be modified to demonstrate that it comes from the parent process, and should happen without substantial delay as another process performs the plotting operation:
